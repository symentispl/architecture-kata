= Let's play

== Product idea

* Online implementation of popular board game „Carcassone”
* People can play over web browser and smart phones, tablets, embedded in Facebook and Google+
* People can play offline, they get notifications over email, social networks and SMS when there is time for their next move
* People choose which extensions they are going to use during play
* Game lasts until somebody reaches x points (we have to recalculate score every time)
* Every player can play in as many games as he/she wants
* Players can play in tournaments
* Promotional code with access to game added to every sold copy (800000 copies sold every year), we expect 80% conversion ratio, so expect steady growth year over year
* Investor doesn’t want to invest to much into new hardware and infrastructure, he already hosts a couple of other browser based games in its own datacenter.
