*Jarosław Pałka* ,
Allegro.tech, JVM, graphs and recently Pony,
hates everything, +
especially lack of humor and critical thinking, +
too old for rock'n'roll

== agenda

* our goals, fun is yours
* setting the ground rules
* architecture committees formation
* design phase
* retrospection

== code of conduct

we are all adults, +
and I assume intelligent human beings

so that's why there is only one rule

respect in tha hood

[%notitle]
== never ever
*never, ever tell* +
*someone something you wouldn't like to hear*

=== ... purpose and structure ...

architecture should answer two fundamental questions +
what is the structure of the system? +
what is the purpose of this structure?

=== kata

=== ... a practice ...

[quote, Wikipedia]
Kata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approach, rather than as individuals in a disorderly manner

== let the struggle begin

you wonder what these things have in common?

=== how to become developer?

[%step]
* you study programming paradigms
* you study programming languages
* you study frameworks
* you write code and write code, and
* .... surprise you write even more code ....

=== how to become architect?

=== books?

[%notitle]
=== !

there are many about architecture patterns, +
not so many about how to apply these, +
how to evaluate architecture and evolve the system

[role="background_title"]
=== university courses?

=== oops, wrong picture

[%notitle]
=== !

or trainings?

hands up who had architecture course at university, +
or who attended architecture training which actually learned you something you applied in real life

[role="background_title"]
=== on the job?

how often you get a chance to create architecture?

it's either your legacy or somebody draw it (yagh) for you

=== pimp my skill!!!

=== you need to practice

== architecture kata

Architectural Kata is an idea developed by Ted Neward and inspired by Fred Brooks „Design of the design”

It is a way to:

* practice process of designing systems,
* practice how to communicate architecture,
* practice „critical thinking”

=== what will happen next

* your „customer” will present a „product idea”, you need to propose architecture of a software system
* you will spent next 90 minutes in groups designing a system
* you will present your „great design” in front of others
* you will have to justify your architecture
* vote! for best architecture

=== ground rules

* Internet access is banned for next 90 minutes
* you may ask the „customer” any question about the project
* you must be prepared to present a rough architectural vision of the project and defend questions about it

=== ground rules

* you must be prepared to ask questions, about others' presentations
* you may safely make assumptions about technologies you don't know well as long as those assumptions are clearly defined and spelled out

=== ground rules

* you may not assume you have hiring/firing authority over the development team
* any technology is fair game (but you must justify its use)

== to design system

== CRC cards

[quote,,Agile Modeling]
  A Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) model (Beck & Cunningham 1989; Wilkinson 1995; Ambler 1995) is a collection of standard index cards that have been divided into three sections, as depicted in Figure 1. A class represents a collection of similar objects, a responsibility is something that a class knows or does, and a collaborator is another class that a class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities. Figure 2 presents an example of two hand-drawn CRC cards.

== to visualize system

== C4 diagrams

[quote,Simon Brown,Coding The Architecture]
The "C4 model" is a hierarchical way to think about the static structures
of a software system in terms of containers, components and classes (or code)

=== !

[quote,Simon Brown,Coding The Architecture]
A software system is made up of one or more containers (web applications, mobile apps,
desktop applications, databases, file systems, etc), each of which contains one or more
components, which in turn are implemented by one or more classes (or code).

=== context

A System Context diagram is a good starting point for
diagramming and documenting a software system,
allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw
a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre,
surrounded by its users and the other systems that it
interacts with. Detail isn't important here as this is your
zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system
landscape. The focus should be on people (actors,
roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than
technologies, protocols and other low-level details.

=== containers

The next step is to illustrate the high-level technology
choices with a Container diagram. A "container" is
something like a web application, mobile app, desktop
application, database, file system, etc. Essentially, a
container is a separately deployable unit that executes
code or stores data. The Container diagram shows the
high-level shape of the software architecture and how
responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows
the major technology choices and how the containers
communicate with one another.

=== components

Next you can zoom in to each container further to
visualise the major structural building blocks and their
interactions. The Component diagram shows how a
container is made up of a number of components,
what each of those components are, their
responsibilities and the technology/implementation
details. If your components don’t all fit on a single
diagram, create multiple versions showing different
portions of the container.
